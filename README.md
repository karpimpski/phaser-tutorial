# Phaser tutorial project using ES6 classes

## The original
If you are interested in learning more about Phaser check out the 
[tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game) I based this project on.

## To run
Ensure that you have Node.js/npm installed. Then, install Express and run the project by running these commands 
from the root of the project:

    npm i
    npm run start

Then, navigate your browser of choice. Since this project uses ES6 modules, your browser may not be able to run the project; 
if this is the case, you may be able to run it by going to your browser configuration and ennabling ES6 modules. 
However, the current versions of all major desktop browsers, excluding Internet Explorer, should support 
ES6 modules by default.
